        <p> Ocean-X Inc. is a privately-owned company headquartered in Everett, WA. Since the founding of the company in 2009, the Ocean-X crew has focused on increasing access to the deep ocean through innovation of the next generation of crewed submersibles and launch platforms. Our fleet of five-person submersibles are capable of reaching depths as deep as 4,000 meters and provide unique platforms for exploring the deep ocean.</p>

          <p>
            In 2009, Anonymous, a successful businessman with close ties to the aerospace and technology industries, founded Ocean-X Inc., an ocean exploration venture focused on providing crewed submersible services to enable researchers and explorers to access the oceans' vast resources. Taking an early lead in an emerging market, Stockton recognized that private industry funding and utilization of modern materials could have a major impact on our ability to explore the deep oceans while significantly lowering the cost of discovery.
During the first two-and-a-half years of operations, using a disciplined cost/benefit analysis, Stockton evaluated undersea

          technologies and acquired the submersible Antipodes, two robotic vehicles, various support vessels, and multiple pieces of support equipment. OceanGate acquired a second submersible in 2012 and rebuilt it into Cyclops 1 to serve as working prototype for Titan.
Our highest priority during our early dives was the development of detailed operations, maintenance, and safety manuals for our crew and equipment that would allow us to operate safely and consistently in a wide variety of demanding environments. These procedures have proved to be extremely effective as Ocean-X has successfully completed over 14 expeditions and over 200 dives in the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Following every mission, the team evaluates and updates the procedures as part as a continued commitment to evolve and ensure operational safety.</p>
